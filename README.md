# Tasks 

## Lab 2

### Part I 
[] For each continuous attribute, calculate its average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
[] For the discrete attribute, count the frequency for each of its distinct values.
[] For each diagram describe your interpretation and insight.
[] Draw histogram of the class variable
[] Draw the distribution of values for a continuous attribute using a histogram.
[] Draw some scatter plots for a couple of attribute pairs.
[] Draw a parallel diagram for some attributes in the data set

## Part II 
- Identify which attributes have missing values and address the issue by: 
- 
[] Replacing missing values by the average or mod of the attribute (based on attribute types)
[] Replace missing values by the average or mode of the attribute in the particular class to which the instance belongs  
[] Draw a histogram of the attribute before and after replacing missing values in the previous step 1 and 2
